# Mask Detection

This project is about building a model that can detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. I build the model using pytorch in jupyter notebook. This project makes use of transfer-learning. I have used vgg19 pretrained model and added new layers on top of them and trained the resultant model.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset) which contains almost 12k images.

## Running the project

The project is developed in google colab as it provides a free T4-GPU with almost 15 gb of VRAM. click on the above badge to open the project in the google colab.
